	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	 <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the computational time
		 an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size 
		 of the input. Efficient algorithms are those with lower 
		 time complexity, making them faster and more scalable.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an 
		algorithm uses relative to the input size. For instance, an 
		algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory 
		proportional to the size of the input.
